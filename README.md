# ⌨ ✔ Intellij Keyboard Layout Fix

This is workaround for IntelliJ on a German keyboard which produces an annoying `µ` on `extract method`-action.  
For now [this bug [IDEA-187355]](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-187355) isn't fixed so we help us out by removing the letter `µ`.  
This is done by a keyboard which is created by the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339).
